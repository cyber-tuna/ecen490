# Note
This is where we stored the code that ran on our robot. This folder encompasses our motion control and our artificial intelligence. Most of this code is VectorKrum's (2015) motion control code. See the [Vector Krum](https://github.com/lukehsiao/RobotSoccer) repository for usage instructions.
