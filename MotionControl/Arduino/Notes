What's the actual inputs to the program?



go to point
  look at PID contrl example from 483, and PID template written in python
  vx/vy or x/y?
  
How should we use the vision? constantly update the target point? 

  
guard goal:
  almost good, except for overshoot
  

move to ball and rush goal:
  state machine teplate
  also need PID controller
  state machine: init, go_to_behind_ball, rush_goal
