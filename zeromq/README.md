# Note

As discussed in our final report, we used a python publisher/subscriber model in our system architecture. The publisher code exists in the vision code. Therefore, the Publisher directory in this folder does not contain any code used in our final robot, but does provide a working example of a python pusblisher and could therefore be valueable.
