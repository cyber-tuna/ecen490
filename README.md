Robot Soccer - Team BaeMax

#### How do I use this repository?
The main program is located at zeromq/subscriber/sub.py. zeromq/subscriber/Experimental contains experimental code that was not used in competition, but could be of value to future teams. See individual repository folders for instructions on how to use. Our team chose not to use the ROS architecture, instead opting for ZeroMQ for communication. The catkin_odroid_ws, catkin_ws, and zerorpc-python folders do not contain any code used on our final robot.
